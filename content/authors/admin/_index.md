Currently I am employed as a research scientist at [deCODE genetics](https://www.decode.com/), working on curring edge genetics research. Before I moved to Iceland I lived in Denmark and the last two years I was employed as a senior software engineer at [Oqton](https://www.oqton.com/), where I worked with awesome talented people building *the operating system for intelligent factories*.

Prior I was a postdoctoral researcher at *DTU Compute* in the **Image Analysis and Computer Graphics** group. I focused my research on Geometric Deep Learning ([gdl Journal Club](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk)). In my PhD I worked primarily on methods and applications in the domain of statistical learning. My PhD thesis is titled [*Sparse Classification - Methods and Applications*](http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/146993098/phd471_Einarsson_G.pdf). Accompanying my thesis is the R-package [accSDA](https://github.com/gumeo/accSDA), also available on CRAN.
