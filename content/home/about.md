# Biography

I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at *DTU Compute* in the **Image Analysis and Computer Graphics** group. I currently focus my research on Geometric Deep Learning ([gdl Journal Club](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk)). In my PhD I worked primarily on methods and applications in the domain of statistical learning. My PhD thesis is titled [*Sparse Classification - Methods and Applications*](http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/146993098/phd471_Einarsson_G.pdf).

The summer of 2018 I will be staying at deCODE genetics in Reykjavik Iceland. I am back at DTU in the fall. I am part of the organizing committee for the group's yearly [summer school](http://optimization-image-analysis.compute.dtu.dk) with DIKU. This year the focus is on optimization in relation to image analysis.
