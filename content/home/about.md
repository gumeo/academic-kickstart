# Biography

I am currently enrolled as a postdoctoral researcher at the Technical University of Denmark. The current focus of my research is Geometric Deep Learning ([gdl Journal Club](http://geo-dl.compute.dtu.dk)). During my PhD I focused primarily on methods and applications in the domain of statistical learning. My PhD thesis is titled [*Sparse Classification - Methods and Applications*](http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/146993098/phd471_Einarsson_G.pdf). Beside my interest in ML, DL and Statistics, I also like to broaden my scope as a software engineer & computer scientist. I like research and building software, seeing something I create work at the end of the day fuels my passion.

The summer of 2018 I will be staying at deCODE in Reykjavik Iceland. I am back at DTU in the fall. I am part of the organizing committee for the group's yearly [summer school](http://optimization-image-analysis.compute.dtu.dk) with DIKU. This year the focus is on optimization in relation to image analysis.
